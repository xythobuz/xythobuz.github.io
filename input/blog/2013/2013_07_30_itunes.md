Ha, finally I found a solution to control iTunes with global Keyboard Hotkeys from my [USB Keyboard][tex] without Media Keys. The solution is quite hacky but should work, even in the future.

First, Open Automator.app and create a new System Service. It should not accept any input and the only Action should be "Run AppleScript", found under "Utilities". Then, enter a script roughly like this and store the Service (click to enlarge):

Repeat this with the "next track" and "playpause" AppleScript commands.

Now, open the System Preferences, go to Keyboard, Keyboard Shortcuts, Services. You should find your newly created Services under General. Assign some shortcuts and you're done :)
