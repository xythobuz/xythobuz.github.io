To avoid unwanted access to my old room, I saw the need to install some kind of additional door lock mechanism.
After taking a look around my parts-bin, I've settled on an RFID-based solution.

Luckily I still had a [serial RFID antenna from Conrad (TowiTek TWT2021)](https://www.conrad.com/p/rfid-antenna-towitek-twt2021-component-33-vdc-5-vdc-191553) lying around.
It simply outputs the ID of a transponder in reach on a serial output with 9600 baud as ASCII string.

Combined with a cheap [door-lock-solenoid from Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00M2M3F74), a [relais-board](https://www.amazon.de/WINGONEER-KY-019-Relais-Shield-Arduino/dp/B06XHJ2PBJ) and a power-supply the project was basically completed.
To easily allow opening the door from the inside, I've added a small push-button that triggers the solenoid to the door-handle.

The code can be found [on my Gitea-Server](https://git.xythobuz.de/thomas/RFID-Door).
