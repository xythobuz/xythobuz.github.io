This was the final set of things I was able to get from my grandparents house before it was sold / cleared.

I'm happy to have gotten the old Zeiss microscope which I used in the past for some soldering jobs.

And most importantly I have the complete set of technical drawings for both the steam engine, as well as for mutliple different steam-water-pump designs.

Also my old model train set is now at my place, though it has to be repaired before it can be used again and I don't have the space for it at the moment.
