Due to a combination of various reasons I haven't actually been doing any [FPV flying](quadcopters.html) for the past five years or so.

This had to change!

## Taranis Firmware

My [Taranis X9D+](https://www.frsky-rc.com/product/taranis-x9d-plus-2/) has been running [OpenTX 2.2](https://www.open-tx.org/) up to now.
But there's a new fork around, called [EdgeTX](http://edgetx.org/).
From a user perspective it's basically the same.
It is useful for potential future use of [ExpressLRS](https://www.expresslrs.org/).

So I upgraded my transmitter.
This brought some headaches, as it turned out because I was trying to flash with a faulty USB port on my PC.
Fortunately even with a completely erased flash the STM32 bootloader is still available via USB, so you can always revive a bricked Taranis without special hardware.

They also added a check for the voltage of the RTC battery, which promptly informed me that it is empty after upgrading the firmware.
Luckily I still had a spare CR1220 watch battery in a drawer, so I just replaced it.

The MicroSD card was also broken, so I had to prepare a fresh one with the usual [LUA scripts](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-tx-lua-scripts) and the [Mia Winter voice pack](https://miawinther.bandcamp.com/album/mia-taranis-voicepack).

## New Copter Batteries

The one thing that was really totally unsalvagable after the five year break was the batteries.
Most had at least one cell completely dead.
I actually tried flying with one of the remaining batteries.
The copter did take off but the voltage immediately sagged to unhealthy levels.

So I got three [Bonka U2 Series 4S 1400mAh 130C](https://www.mylipo.de/Bonka-Lipo-Akku1400mAh-148V-130C-260C-FPV-XT60) LiPos.
Quite pricey but they work fine.

With these I could take my [LX5](lx5.html) out to fly properly again.

])

The copter still pretty much worked fine.
It had some configuration issues, so Smartaudio and the Telemetry UART did not work, but this was already the case when I built it in 2017.

## Upgrading Betaflight

Of course I also had to upgrade Betaflight.
I was still running version 3.5.0 from 2018.
The current version is 4.4.1 which comes with a whole bunch of improvements.

I also took this opportunity to finally put all my old and current [Betaflight config dumps in a Git repo](https://git.xythobuz.de/thomas/copter-configs).

Some slight fixes to the hardware were also needed.
One of the metal stand offs has already sheared, I had to cut a slot into the small remaining thread to get it out.

])

I also noticed that the UARTs for Smartaudio and Telemetry were simply swapped in the config.
After fixing this they both seem to work fine.

## Spectator Monitor

One recurring problem was the power switch of my spectator monitor accidentally getting switched on when putting it back into my backpack.
So I replaced the switch and added an improvised "roll bar" to avoid this issue.

    [ "img/2023_05_13_fpv_6.jpg", "Look inside the spectator monitor (no flash)" ],
])
%-->

While doing this I also noticed that there is also an Arduino in there.
It is used to automatically switch the FPV Receiver on after powering on the whole device.
Unfortunately I can't find the source code, but it is simply toggling a GPIO after some time, so nothing too difficult.

## More Flying

So with the tweaks to my transmitter and copter done I headed off to try it out again.

])

This flight was cut short a little by a local resident.
They informed me that I shouldn't fly there to not interfere with local wildlife.
I was not up to arguing, so I left after only two out of three batteries, or in other words eight instead of twelve minutes of flight time.
I also didn't want to stress the point that this was next to a local small-scale airport, where propeller airplanes like Cessnas regularly take off and land (but not in use on this day).
So I don't think my twelve minutes would have done much harm, relatively speaking.

What can you do?
At least they were nice about it.

## Cat Content

Also I kinda lost possession of [my FPV backpack](https://www.lowepro.com/global/quadguard-bp-x3-lp37090-pww/).
The cats just have to occupy any available surface.
There seems to be no way around it.

But that's ok.
It's just all the hair that's a bit annoying...
