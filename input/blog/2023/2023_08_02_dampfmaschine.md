Today I met with my uncle to go through the workshop in my grandparents old house.
There's quite a bunch of interesting things left, and I was only able to fit a small subset in my car.

Most of the steam-engine-related parts are put into my cellar space for now.
This includes ~35kg coal, cleaning tools and a multitude of spare or unused parts.
Also some tools from the steam-engine-shed.

Two nice lab power supplies, a bunch of filled parts drawers, cables, connectors, etc.
Also my old Wilesco model steam fire engine.

Part 3 will follow this weekend.
