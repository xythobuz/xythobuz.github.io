So as you may know, for a lot of embedded projects I've been using PlatformIO as a build tool.

This will not continue.

Some community member developed support for RP2040 with the Arduino Framework for PlatformIO.
The PlatformIO company [will not merge this Pull Request](https://github.com/platformio/platform-raspberrypi/pull/36) unless the company behind Raspberry Pi will pay them substantial recurring fees.

This is unbelievably appaling.

I will no longer use PlatformIO for any of my projects and strongly encourage you to do the same.

Hopefully someone does a (hostile) fork.
