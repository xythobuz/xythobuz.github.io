description: Replacing broken rear wheel spokes

Driving back home from work on Thursday I suddenly heard a strange noise and felt a wobbly sensation on my bike.
Taking a closer look, it turns out two spokes in the rear wheel have broken.

Over at the [Toolbox Markdorf](https://toolbox-bodensee.de/) we have a bike repair stand and a wheel centering stand, as well as other bike-related tools.
So I drove over there to do the repairs.

On the gear shift side, a small plastic disc prevents the spokes being taken out.
It can simply be pulled off and put back on afterwards.

Removing the brake disc requires a special tool by Shimano, called the ["Lock Ring Tool TL-LR10"](https://amzn.to/3NjrZXA).
Fortunately I already bought that when I rebuilt my wheel.

Here you can see the two broken spokes, next to six unused ones I still had left over, because my rim only needs 32 spokes.

Normally I would have centered and tensioned the rim and spokes myself, but unfortunately [Philipp](https://www.phschoen.de) borrowed the [Spoke Tension Meter](https://amzn.to/38zNXqJ) from the Toolbox Bike Workshop, and I was not able to reach him on short notice ðŸ˜‰

But then I remembered that I saw a small local bike workshop in Markdorf, [Fahrrad Hienerwadel](https://www.fahrradhienerwadel.de).
So I quickly went over there and brought my prepared rim, only needing to center and tension the rims.
The shop owner was able to do the job quickly on-the-spot, in less than 20min with 15â‚¬ having been exchanged, I was on my way back to the Toolbox.

He did a good job centering the wheel.
I put the tube and tire back on and pumped it up, using an old emergency compressor from a Mercedes I salvaged, fed by a 3S Quadcopter LiPo.

Back home, I just had to put the wheel back in the bike frame.
Now it's good to go again!

As I mentioned above, I already completely re-built my rear wheel with new spokes a while ago, in September 2020.
The tools for this were ordered by the Toolbox and are now available there, namely: repair stand, centering stand, tension meter and spoke wrench.

Here are the verbatim notes I made back there, with some specs of my bike and wheel, as well as some useful links if you want to rebuild your wheel as well.

    Speichen-Anzahl n = 32

    286mm ist die korrekte Laenge!

Even though I heard bad things I have to say rebuilding a wheel is not that hard.
Just read through some tutorials on the web or watch some YouTube videos on the topic and try it yourself!
