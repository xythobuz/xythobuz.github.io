Today I had an eye-opening incident while charging a LiPo battery.
It was an SLS Quantum 4S 1500mAh 65C from [StefansLipoShop](https://www.stefansliposhop.de/), but they no longer seem to sell this exact type.

As usual I charged it using my [iSDT D2 smart charger](https://www.isdt.co/d2.html?lang=en).
I heard a strange popping noise and was not sure at first what caused it.
Then I saw this hanging from the charger.

I immediately unplugged it and put it outside on the balcony.
The cells were noticably hot to the touch.
If I hadn't noticed anything I think the charger would have happily continued until a more catastrophic failure would have happened.

After building nicer [storage boxes for my batteries](rc_equipment.html#can_storage) I'm now thinking about only charging in a can as well!
