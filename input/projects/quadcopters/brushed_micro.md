Because I did not really feel comfortable with the large size of both [my first copter](x666.html) and [my tricopter](trifecta.html), I decided to build a very small and lightweight 1S brushed quadcopter.
The frame is 3D printed, but because it did not fit [my 3D printer at the time](fabrikator-mini.html) I had to order it online.

Here are some recordings of the FPV footage.
Be aware that these videos are recorded from the received signal on the ground.
Not only can you see lots of interference and other HF problems, the loss of quality from the video recorder and the YouTube encoding is also very noticeable.
In real-life, the picture doesn't look *that* bad.
