Over the year I have grown quite the collection of self-made or customized gear.

## Spectator Monitor

When out flying alone or with a partner, often people walk their dogs nearby or families go on a walk together and see us.
This often sparks a conversation.
For these occasions, it turned out to be very useful to have some kind of second scree and receiver with me.

A friend of mine even has a spare cheap set of FPV goggles with him most of the time.

I decided to go a slightly different route.
For my first experiments, I bought the [Quanum DIY FPV Goggle Set](https://hobbyking.com/de_de/quanum-diy-fpv-goggle-set-with-monitor-kit.html).
I didn't really like the box-style of goggles, so I quickly took the monitor from the set and used it stand-alone.

After I switched to proper FatShark goggles, I used the Quanum monitor again, this time for a spectator monitor.

I built a simple wooden box out of left-over parts and hot-glue, with a large cut-out in the front for the monitor.

Inside is not only a [FR632 Diversity Rx](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/fr632-diversity-5-8ghz-48ch-auto-scan-lcd-a-v-fpv-receiver.html) but also an [Eachine ProDVR](https://www.banggood.com/Eachine-ProDVR-Pro-DVR-Video-Audio-Mini-Recorder-for-FPV-Multicopters-for-RC-Drone-FPV-Racing-p-1061196.html?cur_warehouse=CN), 2x 18650 cells, voltage regulators, a fan and a voltmeter.
The channel can be selected on the receiver, with cut-outs on the back.
The DVR can be controlled using external push buttons.
A power switch, as well as a switch to select either the Rx video feed or the DVR video feed, are on the top.

The batteries hold up for maybe 3 sessions with spectators.
I had to add the fan after the first tests because it simply got too hot inside the box and the first DVR died after a while.

The quality of the Quanum monitor is great and it does not switch to a blue-screen when the signal is fading.
The DVR does not work 100% reliable, but considering my FatShark Dominator v3 has a built-in DVR as well, I'm not really dependant on it.
