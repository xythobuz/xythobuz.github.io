BaconBar is a small reddit client for Mac OS X, living in the system menu bar.
It was originally called RedditBar, but had to be renamed to be allowed on the Mac App Store.

I put the app into the App Store as a paid app in December 2013.
One year later I would have had to re-new my App Store subscription.
Because of that, I open-sourced the app in December 2014.

The original webpage for BaconBar [can be found here](https://xythobuz.de/baconbar/).

BaconBar has been [reviewed on Softpedia](http://mac.softpedia.com/get/Internet-Utilities/BaconBar.shtml)!

I also wrote [a blog post](2014_12_24_baconbar.html) about making it open-source.
