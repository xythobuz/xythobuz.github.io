In 2016 I've started experimenting with 3D printers.
In the meantime, I've modified my printers quite a bit and also written about it.
Here are all the articles that are part of my 3D printing series:

<!--%
mpages = [p for p in pages if p.get("parent", "") == "3d-printing" and p.lang == "en"]
mpages.sort(key=lambda p: int(p["position"]))
for p in mpages:
    print "  * **[%s](%s)**" % (p.title, p.url) # markdown list item
%-->

If you're interested in my 3D print designs, take a look [at my Thingiverse account](https://www.thingiverse.com/xythobuz/designs) or my [Git Repository](https://git.xythobuz.de/thomas/3d-print-designs).
