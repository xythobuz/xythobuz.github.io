In the last couple of years I built multiple quadcopters and some other related flying remote-controlled model vehicles.
It started with a 500mm span Quadcopter, followed by a smaller Tricopter, then a brushed, as well as a bunch of brushless, micro copters, a flying wing, and lastly a more serious 5" copter.
All of these I'm flying with [FatShark Dominator v3 Camo Blue](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/dominator-v3-hydrodip-camo-blue-white.html) FPV goggles and a [FrSky Taranis X9D Plus SE Camo](https://amzn.to/2RB3o9i) transmitter.

Of course I'm not flying illegally, I have a model flight insurance and I am a registered UAV pilot in the European Union! ðŸ‘®
