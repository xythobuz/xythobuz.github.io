There is this trend of releasing binaries or small utility programs in Web-Forums or loading them onto one-click hosters.  Some years in the future, these forums or hosters probably won't exist anymore, while there is still a need for the software that was provided from there.

Here I'm mirroring/archiving stuff that could get lost.
