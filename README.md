# Website

This is the repo for [my website xythobuz.de](https://www.xythobuz.de).

It uses an (old, modified) version of [poole](https://hg.sr.ht/~obensonne/poole) ported to run on both Python 2 and 3.

Includes [SHJS](https://shjs.sourceforge.net/) and [llightGallery](https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery).

## To Do

All large static files (photos, videos) are just put into this git repo.
That was never a good idea and should be changed.
